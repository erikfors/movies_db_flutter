### Notes

-App uses Flutter, and Dart

## Open-source libraries used

* [DIO](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) - A powerful Http client for Dart, which supports Interceptors, Global configuration, FormData, Request Cancellation, File downloading, Timeout etc. (use for http processing)
* [Flutter_Bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) - Widgets that make it easy to integrate blocs and cubits into Flutter. Built to work with package:bloc. (state managment solution)
* [Equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) - Being able to compare objects in Dart often involves having to override the == operator as well as hashCode. (To compare classes, reduces boilerplate code)
